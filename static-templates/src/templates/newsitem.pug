              | Except Integrated Sustainability launches a new approach to sustainable
              | urban development: Catalytic Buildings. A Catalytic Building helps to
              | ‘sustainify’ an existing urban fabric. Going beyond energy-neutral buildings,
              | a Catalytic Building enhances the autonomy, resilience and/or the equity of the
              | system within which it exists – be it a single neighbourhood or an entire city.  
            p
              | Over the past decade Dutch sustainable development, innovation and design consultancy
              | Except has developed concepts for catalytic buildings. During this time, the urgency to
              | improve urban environments in terms of energy, water, waste, food, ecosystem and socio-
              | economic services has become increasingly apparent. Yet, efforts to tackle these issues
              | is bottlenecked around new energy-neutral and circular buildings.
            p
              | “The majority of the infrastructure that is going to house people this century has already been
              | constructed. So the challenge is not to build new sustainable buildings, but to ‘sus- tainify’
              | the buildings that already exist. For some that’s doable, but most buildings, espe- cially residential
              | houses, won’t experience such major renovations within the next 15 years. This leaves us with a major
              | design flaw in an integral timeframe. The solution is building infrastructure which act as a catalyst,”
              | says Except Director, Tom Bosschaert.
